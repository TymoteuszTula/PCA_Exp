# PCA_Exp
Software that automatize performing principal component analysis on a set of measurements from experiment, stored in textfiles. Software is developed to be used as a python package.

Main goal of this package is to allow for quick implementation of principal component analysis on experimental data. Given few folders with text files that contain different measurements (for example at different temperatures) in the form:
```
x      y      ey
0.1    0.4    0.02
0.2    0.35   0.02
0.3    0.28   0.015
...    ...    ...
```
the code can preprocess it, join different sets of measurements, perform PCA and return the results.
